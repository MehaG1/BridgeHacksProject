      </p>
      <h3>How can we minimise the food wastage</h3>

    <h3>ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLINESS VS ANIMAL CRUELTY</h3>
      <p>Environmet friendliness is the directiy related to our eating habits.Killing poor animals for food is the darkest reality of the twenty first century.200 million animals are killed for food on land EVERY DAY.Including the aquatic animals this figure exceeds 3 billion.That comes out to be around 72 billion land animals and over 1.2 trllion aquatic animals killed just for food around the world every year.</p>
    <h3>HOW CAN TURNING VEGAN HELP</h3>
      <p>Turning vegan is the best way to save the innocent animals. Eating animal and animal products without thinking of the ecological consequences may turn out to be the darkest of human mistakes. Ecology has every element interdependent and an alteration of one leads the comelete destruction of the whole ecological system.Turning vegan not only helps saving innocent animals but also reduces the methane and carbon dioxide emmissions. Thus the best way to serve mother earth is sustainability in food habits and balancing the ecological components.  </p>
    <h3>HOW HAS THE EARTH TURNED INTO A LARGE LANDFILL</h3>
      <p>Currently about 2.01 billion metric tons of municipal solid waste is produced all over the world annually.An estimated 13.5% of the waste is recycled and around 5.5% is composted.This figure shows that we are in a tense situaion demanding more disposal and less production of wastes. Adding more on the list of wastes has turned earth inta a large landfill. The process of waste disposal not only destroys the quality of the product but also degrades the valuable resources. </p>
